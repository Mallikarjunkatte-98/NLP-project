# A2019-IntelligentAutomation-AAillustrates
Training files for the AAillustrates Intelligent Automation Session

The included files are the training/test files that were used in the AAillustrates session to train the MLClassifier app to appropriate sort help desk tickets. With the included files, users should be able to train a model the same way that was presented in the AAillustrates session.

Note: The Full data set was included, though only the train/test version were used in the video. Should you want to try to build your own train/test split, you could do so by starting with the original full data set.

The Ham/Spam test and train data sets used from part 1 of the Intelligent Automation session are available as a part of the application download which can be found here: https://github.com/harish2020Code/MachineLearning-Classification
